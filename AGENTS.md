# clawtel agent guide

## What this project is

clawtel is a single-binary Go CLI that reads token usage counts from a local [Tapes](https://github.com/papercomputeco/tapes) SQLite database and reports them as heartbeats to [claw.tech](https://claw.tech) for leaderboard tracking.

The entire application is one file: `main.go` (~390 lines).

## Architecture

```
tapes.sqlite (nodes table)  -->  clawtel  -->  POST https://ingest.claw.tech/v1/heartbeat
        (local, read-only)       (poll loop)          (claw.tech Supabase edge function)
```

- **Read side:** 4 columns from `nodes`: `created_at`, `model`, `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`
- **Send side:** aggregated heartbeat: `claw_id`, `window_start`, `window_end`, `model`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `message_count`
- **Polling:** every 30 seconds, sends even when idle (uptime ping)
- **Cursor:** timestamp file next to the DB tracks last-seen row

## Security constraints

This is the most important section. clawtel runs on users' machines next to their private conversation data.

- **Never read or access** `content`, `bucket`, `project`, or `agent_name` columns from tapes
- **Never add** session IDs, file paths, hostnames, IP addresses, or any PII to the heartbeat payload
- **Never change** the `heartbeat` struct fields without explicit review — this is the network contract
- **`assertSchema`** must fail hard if required columns are missing and warn about sensitive columns
- **Read-only DB access** — the SQLite connection uses `?mode=ro`
- **No key, no network** — if `CLAW_INGEST_KEY` is unset, exit immediately with no network calls

If you're modifying what clawtel reads or sends, update the security model comment at the top of `main.go` to match.

## Build

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o clawtel .
```

Pure Go via `modernc.org/sqlite` — no CGO, no C toolchain needed.
